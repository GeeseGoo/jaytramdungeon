/*
  Warnings:

  - You are about to alter the column `username` on the `User` table. The data in that column could be lost. The data in that column will be cast from `Text` to `VarChar(255)`.
  - You are about to drop the `Post` table. If the table is not empty, all the data it contains will be lost.
  - You are about to drop the `Profile` table. If the table is not empty, all the data it contains will be lost.
  - You are about to drop the `users` table. If the table is not empty, all the data it contains will be lost.
  - Added the required column `password` to the `User` table without a default value. This is not possible if the table is not empty.
  - Made the column `username` on table `User` required. This step will fail if there are existing NULL values in that column.
